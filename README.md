# OCaml-Compiler
A Ocaml Project done in Sophomore year at UMD

Implementing a lexer and parser for MicroCaml. 
-> Lexer function will convert an input string of MicroCaml into a list of tokens, and parser function will consume these tokens to produce an abstract symbol tree (AST).
-> Also implemented an interpreter to actually execute the produced AST.
